Name: Eyes

Description: Eyes is a project in which I was to complete as a part of a eductional course. 
The project involves a blue webpage with two eyes side by side with each other.
moving the cursor around the screen will cause the eyes in the middle of the screen to follow the direction of the cursor.

How to run: wait for webpage to load the proceed to move cursor in a variety of directions and observe the eyes following your movements

Roadmap of future improvements: in the future I would like the eyes to be more detailed in their visuals including shape and color. 
I also wish to add a button that allows the addition of more eyes.
